The same attack could be used by a malicious image to allow a container process to gain access to the host filesystem through runc run (""attack 1""). Variants of attacks 1 and 2 could be also be used to overwrite semi-arbitrary host binaries, allowing for complete container escapes (""attack 3a"" and ""attack 3b""). runc 1.1.12 includes patches for this issue.","arn:aws:inspector2:us-west-2:329615862535:finding/02126da0469acffb2b84e3bbd8e4d960",2024-10-17T14:22:11.836Z,2024-10-18T15:21:27.622Z,2024-10-18T15:21:27.622Z,i-0fc4959c24f0379e8,,us-west-2,AMAZON_LINUX_2,"owner:OFFSEC, managed_by:Terraform - github.com/twitter-payments/aws-terraform, Name:x-infosec-prod-nest, jira:OFFSEC-52","github.com/containerd/containerd","github.com/containerd/containerd[0/v1.6.1/]","github.com/containerd/containerd[1.7.13]",,"vol-0be129a1e3c194127:/p1:usr/local/bin/helm",,6,"None Provided",8.6,"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H",ACTIVE,CVE-2024-21626,NVD,HIGH,"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21626",2024-01-31T22:15:53Z,8.6,"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H",,,,,,,AWS_EC2_INSTANCE,ami-0815349d9118de817,"100.64.137.218, 35.165.2.11",,,vpc-0025bfc70d1829eff,,0.05062,NO,,,,,"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SYMO3BANINS6RGFQFKPRG4FIOJ7GWYTL/, https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/02/msg00005.html, https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2NLXNE23Q5ESQUAI22Z7A63JX2WMPJ2J/",,GOBINARY

A bug was found in containerd's CRI implementation where a user can exhaust memory on the host. In the CRI stream server, a goroutine is launched to handle terminal resize events if a TTY is requested. If the user's process fails to launch due to, for example, a faulty command, the goroutine will be stuck waiting to send without a receiver, resulting in a memory leak. Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use containerd's CRI implementation and the stream server is used for handling container IO. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.12 and 1.5.16. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that only trusted images and commands are used and that only trusted users have permissions to execute commands in running containers.","arn:aws:inspector2:us-west-2:329615862535:finding/03167e16ba25170eaf2781faad92716e",2024-10-17T14:22:11.836Z,2024-10-18T15:21:27.622Z,2024-10-18T15:21:27.622Z,i-0fc4959c24f0379e8,,us-west-2,AMAZON_LINUX_2,"owner:OFFSEC, managed_by:Terraform - github.com/twitter-payments/aws-terraform, Name:x-infosec-prod-nest, jira:OFFSEC-52","github.com/containerd/containerd","github.com/containerd/containerd[0/v1.6.1/]","github.com/containerd/containerd[1.6.12]",,"vol-0be129a1e3c194127:/p1:usr/local/bin/helm",,6,"None Provided",6.5,"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H",ACTIVE,CVE-2022-23471,NVD,MEDIUM,"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23471",2022-12-07T23:15:09Z,6.5,"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H",,,,,,,AWS_EC2_INSTANCE,ami-0815349d9118de817,"100.64.137.218, 35.165.2.11",,,vpc-0025bfc70d1829eff,,9.7E-4,NO,,,,,"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202401-31",,GOBINARY

While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection.

A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where supplementary groups are not set up properly. If an attacker has direct access to a container and manipulates their supplementary group access, they may be able to use supplementary group access to bypass primary group restrictions in some cases, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or gaining the ability to execute code in that container.

When using urllib3's proxy support with `ProxyManager`, the `Proxy-Authorization` header is only sent to the configured proxy, as expected. However, when sending HTTP requests *without* using urllib3's proxy support, it's possible to accidentally configure the `Proxy-Authorization` header even though it won't have any effect as the request is not using a forwarding proxy or a tunneling proxy. In those cases, urllib3 doesn't treat the `Proxy-Authorization` HTTP header as one carrying authentication material and thus doesn't strip the header on cross-origin redirects. Because this is a highly unlikely scenario, we believe the severity of this vulnerability is low for almost all users. Out of an abundance of caution urllib3 will automatically strip the `Proxy-Authorization` header during cross-origin redirects to avoid the small chance that users are doing this on accident.

Moby's networking implementation allows for many networks, each with their own IP address range and gateway, to be defined. This feature is frequently referred to as custom networks, as each network can have a different driver, set of parameters and thus behaviors. When creating a network, the `--internal` flag is used to designate a network as _internal_. The `internal` attribute in a docker-compose.yml file may also be used to mark a network _internal_, and other API clients may specify the `internal` parameter as well.When containers with networking are created, they are assigned unique network interfaces and IP addresses. The host serves as a router for non-internal networks, with a gateway IP that provides SNAT/DNAT to/from container IPs.Containers on an internal network may communicate between each other, but are precluded from communicating w","arn:aws:inspector2:us-west-2:329615862535:finding/2465b5f2e17d13b1cf74f2f7a4859d84",2024-10-17T14:22:11.836Z,2024-10-18T15:21:27.622Z,2024-10-18T15:21:27.622Z,i-0fc4959c24f0379e8,,us-west-2,AMAZON_LINUX_2,"owner:OFFSEC, managed_by:Terraform - github.com/twitter-payments/aws-terraform, Name:x-infosec-prod-nest, jira:OFFSEC-52",github.com/docker/docker,"github.com/docker/docker[0/v20.10.12+incompatible/]","github.com/docker/docker[26.0.0-rc3]",,"vol-0be129a1e3c194127:/p1:usr/local/bin/helm",,6,"None Provided",,,ACTIVE,CVE-2024-29018,NVD,,"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29018",2024-03-20T21:15:31Z,,,,,,,,,AWS_EC2_INSTANCE,ami-0815349d9118de817,"100.64.137.218, 35.165.2.11",,,vpc-0025bfc70d1829eff,,4.3E-4,NO,,,,,,,GOBINARY

A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) prior to version 20.10.14 where containers were incorrectly started with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during `execve(2)`. Normally, when executable programs have specified permitted file capabilities, otherwise unprivileged users and processes can execute those programs and gain the specified file capabilities up to the bounding set. Due to this bug, containers which included executable programs with inheritable file capabilities allowed otherwise unprivileged users and processes to additionally gain these inheritable file capabilities up to the container's bounding set.

While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection.

Also, changes to some instructions (most important being HEALTHCHECK and ONBUILD) would not cause a cache miss. An attacker with the knowledge of the Dockerfile someone is using could poison their cache by making them pull a specially crafted image that would be considered as a valid cache candidate for some build steps. 23.0+ users are only affected if they explicitly opted out of Buildkit (DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 environment variable) or are using the /build API endpoint. All users on versions older than 23.0 could be impacted.

329615862535,HIGH,YES,PACKAGE_VULNERABILITY,"CVE-2023-39325 - golang.org/x/net","A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2.

As RAPL is an interface to access a hardware feature, it is only available when running on bare metal with the module compiled into the kernel.By 2019, it was realized that in some cases unprivileged access to RAPL readings could be exploited as a power-based side-channel against security features including AES-NI (potentially inside a SGX enclave) and KASLR (kernel address space layout randomization).

While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection.

A security vulnerability has been detected in certain versions of Docker Engine, which could allow an attacker to bypass authorization plugins (AuthZ) under specific circumstances. The base likelihood of this being exploited is low.Using a specially-crafted API request, an Engine API client could make the daemon forward the request or response to an authorization plugin without the body. In certain circumstances, the authorization plugin may allow a request which it would have otherwise denied if the body had been forwarded to it.A security issue was discovered In 2018, where an attacker could bypass AuthZ plugins using a specially crafted API request.

To facilitate this, Intel introduced the powercap framework in Linux kernel 3.13, which reads values via relevant MSRs (model specific registers) and provides unprivileged userspace access via `sysfs`. As RAPL is an interface to access a hardware feature, it is only available when running on bare metal with the module compiled into the kernel.By 2019, it was realized that in some cases unprivileged access to RAPL readings could be exploited as a power-based side-channel against security features including AES-NI (potentially inside a SGX enclave) and KASLR (kernel address space layout randomization).

Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send.

Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send. The fix sets a limit on the amount of excess header frames we will process before closing a connection.","arn:aws:inspector2:us-west-2:329615862535:finding/9d6ac646ef95f1dc3f0a372413ddc629",2024-10-08T19:52:03.234Z,2024-10-08T19:52:03.234Z,2024-10-08T19:52:03.234Z,"arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:329615862535:function:eks-aws-auth-addon-prod-us-west-2:$LATEST",,us-west-2,PROVIDED_AL2023,,golang.org/x/net,"golang.org/x/net[0/v0.0.0-20220127200216-cd36cc0744dd/]",golang.org/x/net[0.23.0],,bootstrap,,15,"None Provided",,,ACTIVE,CVE-2023-45288,NVD,,"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45288",2024-04-04T21:15:16Z,,,,,,,,,AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION,,,,,vpc-007485b44b449a6c0,,4.4E-4,NO,,,ZIP,2024-10-08T19:51:36.898Z,"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QRYFHIQ6XRKRYBI2F5UESH67BJBQXUPT/, https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/YgW0sx8mN3M",,GO

In client_golang prior to version 1.11.1, HTTP server is susceptible to a Denial of Service through unbounded cardinality, and potential memory exhaustion, when handling requests with non-standard HTTP methods. In order to be affected, an instrumented software must use any of `promhttp.InstrumentHandler*` middleware except `RequestsInFlight`; not filter any specific methods (e.g GET) before middleware; pass metric with `method` label name to our middleware; and not have any firewall/LB/proxy that filters away requests with unknown `method`. client_golang version 1.11.1 contains a patch for this issue. Several workarounds are available, including removing the `method` label name from counter/gauge used in the InstrumentHandler; turning off affected promhttp handlers; adding custom middleware before promhttp handler that will sanitize the req","arn:aws:inspector2:us-west-2:329615862535:finding/a2a0cc1821a683daf0996a59069f086d",2024-10-17T14:22:02.353Z,2024-10-18T15:21:23.501Z,2024-10-18T15:21:23.501Z,i-0232d46075f8e713f,,us-west-2,AMAZON_LINUX_2,Name:payments-prod-nest,"github.com/prometheus/client_golang","github.com/prometheus/client_golang[0/v1.11.0/]","github.com/prometheus/client_golang[1.11.1]",,"vol-0c85daa9bdfef40e9:/p1:usr/local/bin/helm",,6,"None Provided",7.5,"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H",ACTIVE,CVE-2022-21698,NVD,HIGH,"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21698",2022-02-15T16:15:08Z,7.5,"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H",,,,,,,AWS_EC2_INSTANCE,ami-0815349d9118de817,"100.21.31.140, 100.64.128.26",,,vpc-007485b44b449a6c0,,0.00652,NO,,,,,"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KBMVIQFKQDSSTHVVJWJ4QH6TW3JVB7XZ/, https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZY2SLWOQR4ZURQ7UBRZ7JIX6H6F5JHJR/, https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/J5WPM42UR6XIBQNQPNQHM32X7S4LJTRX/, https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MH6ALXEQXIFQRQFNJ5Y2MJ5DFPIX76VN/, https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SASRKYHT5ZFSVMJUQUG3UAEQRJYGJKAR/, https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AK7CJBCGERCRXYUR2EWDSSDVAQMTAZGX/, https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RN7JGC2LVHPEGSJYODFUV5FEKPBVG4D7/, https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/7V7I72LSQ3IET3QJR6QPAVGJZ4CBDLN5/, https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2IK53GWZ475OQ6ENABKMJMTOBZG6LXUR/, https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HLAQRRGNSO5MYCPAXGPH2OCSHOGHSQMQ/, https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4KDETHL5XCT6RZN2BBNOCEXRZ2W3SFU3/, https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DLUJZV3HBP56ADXU6QH2V7RNYUPMVBXQ/, https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/36GUEPA5TPSC57DZTPYPBL6T7UPQ2FRH/, https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/3L6GDN5S5QZSCFKWD3GKL2RDZQ6B4UWA/, https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2PFW6Q2LXXWTFRTMTRN4ZGADFRQPKJ3D/, https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FY3N7H6VSDZM37B4SKM2PFFCUWU7QYWN/, https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZKORFJTRRDJCWBTJPISKKCVMMMJBIRLG/, https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/5OGNAFVXSMTTT2UPH6CS3IH6L3KM42Q7/",,GOBINARY

It includes a utility class, HttpURI, for URI/URL parsing.The HttpURI class does insufficient validation on the authority segment of a URI. However the behaviour of HttpURI differs from the common browsers in how it handles a URI that would be considered invalid if fully validated against the RRC. Specifically HttpURI and the browser may differ on the value of the host extracted from an invalid URI and thus a combination of Jetty and a vulnerable browser may be vulnerable to a open redirect attack or to a SSRF attack if the URI is used after passing validation checks.","arn:aws:inspector2:us-west-2:329615862535:finding/a3f59611287d1b1cfd04679f314fc261",2024-10-21T18:11:11.481Z,2024-10-21T18:16:31.917Z,2024-10-21T18:16:31.917Z,"arn:aws:ecr:us-west-2:329615862535:repository/utils/sha256:b13b8cb24c8a8280f3fee64d9c8eb32fb1f5ad8432c71dff7ea474d4a203130f","latest, 2024102101",us-west-2,DEBIAN_12,,"org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-http, org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-server","org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-http[0/9.4.54.v20240208/], org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-server[0/9.4.54.v20240208/]","org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-http[12.0.12], org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-server[12.0.12]",,"home/root/kafka/libs/jetty-http-9.4.54.v20240208.jar",,2,"None Provided",,,ACTIVE,CVE-2024-6763,NVD,,"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-6763",2024-10-14T16:15:04Z,,,,,,,,,AWS_ECR_CONTAINER_IMAGE,,,,,,,4.5E-4,NO,,,,,"https://gitlab.eclipse.org/security/cve-assignement/-/issues/25",,"JAR, JAR"

While this could be used to create empty files, existing files would not be truncated. An attacker must have the ability to start containers using some kind of custom volume configuration. Containers using user namespaces are still affected, but the scope of places an attacker can create inodes can be significantly reduced. Sufficiently strict LSM policies (SELinux/Apparmor) can also in principle block this attack -- we suspect the industry standard SELinux policy may restrict this attack's scope but the exact scope of protection hasn't been analysed.

This stack-protector failure only applies to C99-style dynamically-sized local variables or those created using alloca(). The stack-protector operates as intended for statically-sized local variables. The default behavior when the stack-protector detects an overflow is to terminate your application, resulting in controlled loss of availability. An attacker who can exploit a buffer overflow without triggering the stack-protector might be able to change program flow control to cause an uncontrolled loss of availability or to go further and affect confidentiality or integrity.

Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send.

The base likelihood of this being exploited is low.Using a specially-crafted API request, an Engine API client could make the daemon forward the request or response to an authorization plugin without the body. In certain circumstances, the authorization plugin may allow a request which it would have otherwise denied if the body had been forwarded to it.A security issue was discovered In 2018, where an attacker could bypass AuthZ plugins using a specially crafted API request. This could lead to unauthorized actions, including privilege escalation.

This stack-protector failure only applies to C99-style dynamically-sized local variables or those created using alloca(). The stack-protector operates as intended for statically-sized local variables. The default behavior when the stack-protector detects an overflow is to terminate your application, resulting in controlled loss of availability. An attacker who can exploit a buffer overflow without triggering the stack-protector might be able to change program flow control to cause an uncontrolled loss of availability or to go further and affect confidentiality or integrity.
